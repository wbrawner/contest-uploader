# Contest Image Uploader

A WordPress plugin originally built for the Xubuntu 16.04 LTS wallpaper contest. Allows users to upload an image that is submitted for review. Upon approval, the image is displayed on the page/post of the admin's choosing.

Currently adding in more features, like a built-in ability to vote on the images. Contributions are welcome
